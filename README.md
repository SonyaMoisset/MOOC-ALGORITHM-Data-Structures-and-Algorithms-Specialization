# Data Structures and Algorithms Specialization
## Master Algorithmic Programming Techniques.
### Created by The University of California, San Diego & Higher School of Economics

The Specialization covers algorithmic techniques for solving problems arising in computer science applications. It is a mix of theory and practice: you will not only design algorithms and estimate their complexity, but you will get a deeper understanding of algorithms by implementing them in the programming language of your choice.

This Specialization is unique, because you will have a choice between two Capstone Projects, developed in partnership with industry leaders. In the Shortest Paths Capstone, you'll deal with road network analysis and social network analysis. You'll learn how to compute the fastest route between New York and Mountain View thousands of times faster than classic algorithms and close to those used in Google Maps.
